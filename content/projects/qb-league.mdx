## The Problem

My friends and I run a fantasy football league with a twist: we only draft quarterbacks. Standard fantasy platforms don't handle this well. The scoring is different, the strategy is different, and we wanted a place to track our league's history and trash talk.

## The Solution

I built qbleague.xyz from scratch using Next.js and TypeScript. It handles our custom scoring rules, maintains historical records going back years, and gives us a dedicated home for the league.

## Features

The site tracks current standings, historical winners, and head-to-head records. It's designed to be fast, mobile-friendly, and just fun to use when checking scores on Sunday.

## Why Build It?

Partly because the existing platforms didn't fit our format. Partly because I wanted an excuse to build something for my friends. It's become a small tradition: every season, the site gets a few updates and we all check it religiously during games.
