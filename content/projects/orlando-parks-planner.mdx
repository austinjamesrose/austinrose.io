## The Context

Planning a Disney trip with kids is genuinely complex. Which park which day? What order to hit rides? When to take breaks? I wanted something smarter than a spreadsheet but more personal than generic touring plans.

## What It Does

The app pulls real-time wait time data and park information, then uses Anthropic's Claude API to generate suggested itineraries. You tell it your party composition (ages, preferences, must-dos) and it builds a day plan that accounts for geography, wait times, and realistic pacing.

## How I Use It

This was built for our family's actual trip. I can tweak preferences, regenerate plans, and adjust on the fly. It's not a polished product for the masses; it's a tool that made our vacation planning genuinely easier.

## The Tech

React frontend hosted on GitHub Pages, hitting the Anthropic API for the intelligence layer. The prompt engineering took more iteration than the UI: getting Claude to understand park geography and make sensible recommendations required careful context design.
