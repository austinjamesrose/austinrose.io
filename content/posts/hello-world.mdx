# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first post on the new site. I'm excited to share my thoughts on People Analytics, data visualization, and the intersection of HR and technology.

## What to Expect

Here's what I'll be writing about:

- **People Analytics** - Insights from working with workforce data
- **Data Visualization** - Best practices and creative approaches
- **Career Development** - Lessons learned along the way
- **Technical Deep Dives** - Code, tools, and methodologies

## A Quick Example

Here's a code snippet to demonstrate MDX with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
interface Employee {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  department: string;
  hireDate: Date;
}

function calculateTenure(employee: Employee): number {
  const now = new Date();
  const diffTime = Math.abs(now.getTime() - employee.hireDate.getTime());
  const diffDays = Math.ceil(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  return Math.floor(diffDays / 365);
}
```

## Stay Tuned

More posts coming soon. In the meantime, feel free to explore the rest of the site and check out my [work](/work) and [experience](/experience).
